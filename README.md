Moving to the acknowledgment and assignment step, osTicket's automated system efficiently routes the ticket to the relevant team or agent. An assigned agent promptly acknowledges the critical nature of the business outage.

As the agent addresses the issue, a continual loop of resolution and communication ensues. Clear updates are provided to Karen, maintaining transparency throughout the process.
